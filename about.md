Later worked as an Analyst for an year at Mobius Knowledge services in Chennai.

To speak more about me, a budding data scientist who is currently looking out for full time data science job opportunities at USA. I love [photography](www.instagram.com/anirudhkm), which helps me to see the world through my third eye. Added to these, I have great affinity towards literature, trying to learn Vedas a bit and the classic tamil texts Thirukural and divya prabandham.
