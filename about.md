I am Anirudh K Muralidhar (Ani), born and brought up in the exciting city of Chennai, India. I did my undergraduate (2010-2014) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, and my Masters in Data Science. currently, I am working as a Data Scientist with eBay, California.

See my experience to know more about my work.

More about me, I love photography, which gives me a chance to see the world through my third eye. Added to these, I have a great affinity for ancient literature, as I am trying to learn Vedas a bit and the classic tamil texts such as *Thirukural* and *divya prabandham*.

Also, I'm running a magazine by the name [Velvi](https://www.anirudhkm.com/magazine/), please refer to the link for more details.
