## TASK ONE - RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

#### **OVERALL**

We build a recommender system for movies based on their ratings using various distance and similarity measures.

#### **DATASET**

The [movielens dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) is used to serve the purpose with 100K data points.

#### **METHODS**

In case one we develop the system using the rating feature alone using distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan and L<sub>max</sub>.
We also, continue to develop the recommender system based on factors such as movie genre, user's gender and others. These systems are evaluated using Mean Absolute Difference(MAD).

#### **RESULTS**
