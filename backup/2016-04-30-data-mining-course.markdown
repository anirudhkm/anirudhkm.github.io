## TASK ONE - RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

#### **OVERALL**

We build a recommender system for movies based on their ratings using various distance and similarity measures.

#### **DATASET**

The [movielens dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) is used to serve the purpose with 100K data points.

#### **METHODS**

In case one we develop the system using the rating feature alone using distance metrics such as Euclidean, Manhattan and L<sub>max</sub>.
We also continue to develop the recommender system based on factors such as movie genre, user's gender and others. These systems are evaluated using Mean Absolute Difference(MAD).

#### **RESULTS**

## TASK TWO - DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION

This is similar to the one that I have worked [here](/projects/2016-11-30-decision-tree-bag-boost.markdown)

## TASK THREE - IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSOCIATION RULES

#### **OVERALL**

The aim is to implement mine association rules from a given transcation data.

#### **DATASET**

The transaction data are synthesized from the datasets such as [mushroom](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom), [solar](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Solar+Flare) and [nursery](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/nursery) which are available from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).

#### **METHODS**

First, we implement the association rule program code and then test them by varying the support and set the threshold for confidence and lift.

#### **RESULTS**
