## **Analyst at Mobius Knowledge Services**, Chennai, India (June 2014 - June 2015)

I joined Mobius as an Analyst with the freshers tag. The experience that I ate here was on of the motivating factors for me to do my Masters in Data Science degree. Within a short span of my tenure, I was handling high responsibilites due to my analytics and Python programming skills. Here are few things that I worked on.

* Developed generalized scripts to crawl data from web as per requirement using regular expression, bs4 with Python which yielded in 98% accuracy for each website tested.
* Developed scripts to analyze the crawled data such as price comparison, price trend of a particular product over the time using Python.
* Developed scripts to crack captcha from image data using Python packages numpy, cv2 which resulted in accuracy of 84% when tested on 1000 data and took 6 seconds to crack each captcha.
* Trained a set of 15 employees on Python over a period of 2 months which increased the usage of Python for developing by 4%.
