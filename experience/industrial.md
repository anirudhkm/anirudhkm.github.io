## **Analyst at Mobius Knowledge Services**, Chennai, India (June 2014 - June 2015)

I joined Mobius as an Analyst with the freshers tag. The experience that I ate here was on of the motivating factors for me to do my Masters in Data Science degree. Within a short span of my tenure, I was handling high responsibilites due to my analytics and Python programming skills. Here are few things that I worked on.

* Developed generalized scripts to crawl data from web as per requirement using regular expression, bs4 with Python which yielded in 98% accuracy for each website tested.

* Developed scripts to analyze the crawled data such as price comparison, price trend of a particular product over the time using Python.

* Developed scripts to crack captcha from image data using Python packages numpy, cv2 which resulted in accuracy of 84% when tested on 1000 data and took 6 seconds to crack each captcha.

* Trained a set of 15 employees on Python over a period of 2 months which increased the usage of Python for developing by 4%. 

## **Data Science Intern at Land's End**, Dodgeville, Wisconsin (May 2016 - August 2016)

I was hired as a Data Science intern at Land's End by the marketing department. The motive behind my employment was to drive maketing based on data. With the support of my manager [Shaishav Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaish), I was able to bring in my best to the organization.

The intern experience was complete with 30 of us in total. Right from the orientation, trekking experience, lake cleaning experience, leadership sessions and books. Also, I lived in Madison, Wisconsin during this period and I will cherish each drop of memory that I gained here.

Here are my works during my summer intern

* Worked closely with the marketing department to develop data driven marketing strategies.

* Developed a customer segmentation model based on their demographic and purchase pattern in order to have a better understanding of our customers.

* Developed a prediction model to find the category preference of a given customer through different approches.

* Led a team of four undergraduates from different domains where we explored and presented ways to make Landsâ€™End an Omni-channel model to drive processes. We communicated with different people from different  departments to derive conclusions on our work. It was great working on a project where I had no background.

Overall, I felt this intern experience is a gem. It helped to learn much more about the work culture here in U.S.A and the people as well.

## **Appointed for Special projects at Land's End**, Dodgeville, Wisconsin (September 2016 - December 2016)

After my summer intern, my internship was extended by Land's End to continue my work. So, I had the opportunity to work in remote from my university. The motive was to work extensively on projects such as recommendation system and churn prediction.

* Developed a recommendation system based on product attributes and on customer purchase pattern which lifted the recommendation revenue by 3 percent.

* Worked on a market basket analysis to mine association rules from transaction data.

* Developed a churn prediction model to predict customers who are likely to churn out and find the factors which influences this churn.
