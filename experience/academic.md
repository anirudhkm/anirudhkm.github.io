## **Projects**

My projects and work primarily revolve around Machine Learning(supervised and unsupervised), Data Mining and exploratory analysis. I try to pick data from domains such as medical, sports because of their importance and the impact they can make. Please see my [resume](cv.md) to get an overview of my overall work.

## **Associate Instructor**

Starting from spring 2016, I have been serving as an Associate Instructor for the course I210 - Information Infrastructure. The course focuses on the basics of Python programming language.

My role involves to lead the other Associate Instructors, supervise their performance, keep track of students score and attendance. Also, each week I conduct lab to give hands on experience to students and hold office hours as well.

Office hours timing: Tuesday (2 - 4 PM)
