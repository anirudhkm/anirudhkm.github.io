Right from my childhood, I have looked up to many people for inspiration in order to be successful. People like Dr Abdul Kalam, Swami Desikan, Steve Jobs and others have influenced me on the way I think and my perspective on this world.

The important attributes that I learned from these people are being genuine and striving to give your best. These are what transform a person from coal to a diamond.

I never had the privilege to meet these people, but at the same time I had the blessing to live with one such diamond throughout my life; my mother. She is just the personification of all inspiring persons who has directed all her energy towards the welfare of her family.

>*She is not the fittest person, but becomes the most energetic when it matters!*  
>*She is not the best cook, but ensures that she cooks the best for me!*
>*She is not the best teacher, but gives her best when she teaches me!*
>*She is not the richest, but always gives her best to satisfy me!*
>*She is not a warrior, but saves her best to protect me!*

This list could go on, but the beauty is that she does these not for any recognition, but out of pure love. She is just the classic example of what love can achieve. Whatever I do to her, it can’t even touch what she did to me. 

I just bow down to my mother and extend this to all mothers across all living species. 

The world too is in need of people with motherly characteristics; it would definitely have a great impact on the environment and lives of many people. Mother Earth has been feeding us so kindly, it’s high time we protect her so that she can still continue to feed us and our future generations.

“Let us remember we are nothing without our mother (Earth).”
