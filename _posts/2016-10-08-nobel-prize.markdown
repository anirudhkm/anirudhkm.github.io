The moment you read the title, you might think that the world would need to be completely devoid of peace for there to be no Nobel peace prize. True, that is one way, but my view is exactly the opposite of what you might think.


We all know that the Nobel Prize is such a prestigious award that one can receive, and of all the categories, I rate peace as the top because of its need and how it tells the world about the great work done by people like Juan Manuel Santos, Malala Yousafzai, Kailash Satyarthi, Barack Obama and others that needs to be known by all.


But let’s put it this way,  if all the people in the world owned tons of gold, then there is no use in people having pride in owning gold. In the same way, if each and every individual showers love and peace on others and themselves, then there would be nothing extraordinary in acts of peace and love, then at a particular point there is no valid reason to award a person for peace because everyone shows such character, which obviously leads to a time where there would be no Nobel Prize, or any other awards, for peace.


I know this sounds way too optimistic, and even impossible, but there is always the  opportunity to try creating a world which is more beautiful than heaven, a world where we see God in everyone, it just requires each individual’s will toward this, and to protect mother Earth, which has been nurturing us since the inception of living beings.
