I have a great passion towards learning literature, especially ancient literature of India (Tamil and Sanskrit). Tamil gems such as 4000 Divya Prabhandham, Thirukkural are a great inspiration for me. Also, I am currently learning the sacred text Vedas (Krishna Yajur Veda - Thaithriya shakha)from Ahobila Mutt patashala(school) in Chennai.

The motivation for this comes from my grandfather *Kamalapuram V Santana Gopalachariar*, who lived as a great Vedic scholar and who served as an *Asthana Vidwan* in Ahobila Mutt and Sringeri Mutt. He mastered the Ghanam form of Vedas, Tamil and Sanskrit literatures and who could play Vedas in the musical instrument Veena.
