<center>360 degree view of my patashala taken during Dec. 2016</center>

I have a great passion towards learning literature, especially ancient literature of India (Tamil and Sanskrit). Tamil gems such as 4000 Divya Prabhandham, Thirukkural are a great inspiration for me. Also, I am currently learning the sacred text Vedas (Krishna Yajur Veda - Thaithriya shakha) from Ahobila Mutt patashala(school) in Chennai.

The motivation for this comes from my grandfather *Kamalapuram V Santana Gopalachariar*, who lived as a great Vedic scholar and who served as an *Asthana Vidwan* in Ahobila Mutt and Sringeri Mutt. He mastered the Ghanam form of Vedas, Tamil and Sanskrit literatures and who could play Vedas in the musical instrument Veena.

I personally believe that each culture has its own uniqueness and value and we people need to have pride in our own culture and try our best to safegaurd that and respect others.
