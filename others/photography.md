For the past 5-6 years I have gained friends who are really good at photography and shooting films. Seeing their work always amuses me how photography can feed in positive emotions to you. During my undergraduate studies, I could not afford to buy a camera. But, I always tried to click through my eyes and visualize how I could capture my surroundings.

Finally, I bought my camera Nikon D5300 with my internship salary at Lands' End. From then me and my camera have been walking a great journey. Though, I have no professional education in photography, I enjoy this atmost. My third eye(camera) gives me a new perspective on how I percieve things.

Another inspiration comes from my mother, she has captured my entire childhood with photos. Whenever, I see these photos, my heart smiles. So, for these reasons I have an affinity towards photography.
